# Phishing Detector with OpenAI and Streamlit

This project is a web-based application designed to identify potential phishing emails using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API and Natural Language Processing. The interface is built using Streamlit and offers a simple, accessible way to analyze emails directly from your browser.

## Overview

The phishing detector allows users to interact with the system in two ways:

1. **Manual Input**: Users can copy and paste the content of a suspicious email directly into the text box for analysis.
2. **Image Upload**: Users can upload a screenshot or image of the email. The application uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract the text and then analyzes it for phishing patterns.

Once the text is processed, the system uses OpenAI's language model to evaluate whether the content resembles common phishing tactics. The results are displayed in a clear format, indicating whether the message is likely phishing or legitimate, along with a brief reasoning behind the classification.

## How to Use

- Visit the Streamlit application (URL provided by the project author or deployed instance).
- Choose whether to paste text manually or upload an image.
- Click the analyze button.
- View the classification and reasoning.
- Use the insights to decide if the email is safe or suspicious.

This tool is intended for educational and awareness purposes, helping users better understand how phishing works and how AI can assist in detecting it.
